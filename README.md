# AutoGraderProject
## Version
Version 1.0.0
## About
This grading tool is developed for a Bachelor End Project at the TU/e. This autograding tool, as it already says, tries to automatically grade assignments. These assigments consist of students having to model and control a plant which has to perform a certain task. The grading tool is made initiate tests on the performance of the controllers, made by the students. These tests are performed in the Digital Twin environment in Unity. The tool will cycle through all supplied assignments, start all the selected tests and record their perfomance. After this performance is recorded, it tests the videos with an already trained Machine Learning algorithm, which determines if the test is performed correctly. All information of an assignment for all different tests combined, results in the grade for the assignement, which is added to a text file containing all the grades. 
## Installation
TODO: add install package.
(Required packages)
## Configuration
This chapter is split into two parts, as this tool can be used for grading. But this tool also needs further improvements to make the grading experience and performance even better.
### Use for grading
Follow the steps for the installation and run the grader.exe (to be added). After this application is ran, the application will start itself. 

### Use for development
For development one needs an IDE to work with the python scripts. This project is made with PyCharm, but you are free to use whatever you want. The seperate files are made as structured and clean as possible to make it easier to work with.
