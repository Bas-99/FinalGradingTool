## About
This grading tool is developed for a Bachelor End Project at the TU/e. This autograding tool, as it already says, tries to automatically grade assignments. These assigments consist of students having to model and control a plant which has to perform a certain task. The grading tool is made initiate tests on the performance of the controllers, made by the students. These tests are performed in the Digital Twin environment in Unity. The tool will cycle through all supplied assignments, start all the selected tests and record their perfomance. After this performance is recorded, it tests the videos with an already trained Machine Learning algorithm, which determines if the test is performed correctly. All information of an assignment for all different tests combined, results in the grade for the assignement, which is added to a text file containing all the grades.
